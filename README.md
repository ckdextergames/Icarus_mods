Compatible with Icarus Week 77 update:

<a name="mod">__SuperDeluxe Combo__</a>

This all-in-one package integrates the following:

* The expansive WZG Icarus-balance-overhaul mod, tweaked thusly:
   * Rope from fiber can be crafted on the Character in addition to the Crafting Bench
   * Workshop repair kits can be crafted in the Fabricator
   * The Workshop repair kit pack includes 10 repair kits plus an assortment of T4 goodies, and costs quite a bit more to research and buy
   * More food buff slots
   * The MXC furnace smelts like an electric furnace (and costs more)
   * The Larkwell arrow and crossbow bolt bundles contain 50, not 25 per pack
   * Crumbed Fish is a "powerfood," giving 200 max health and stamina, and 30% stamina regeneration. Slightly increased recipe requirements. 
* JimK72's Custom_Puck_Lights and Camera_Distance mods (as-is)
* Critfail's "Blessing of Tartarus" mod (as-is)
* An enhanced versions of CritFail's WasteNot_All (giving you a higher chance for more exotics)

* __Caution__: This mod changes stack sizes. Be warned that if you use this mod, and then use no mods or different mods during a prospect or in the same Open World/Outpost, you will likely lose some or even all inventory. It is best to stay with one stack-size-changing mod for a given prospect or Open World.
