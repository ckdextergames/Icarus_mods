<a name="mod">__Dexterhaven Labs__</a>

Dexterhaven Labs introduces a custom tab to the Orbital Workshop, containing many useful items.

Included:

__Hit the Ground Running__

Brought to you by DexterHaven Outfitters LTD, these Icarus Starter Packs and Prefabs contain everything a prospector needs to get started on the surface. From the bare-bones, *"I just need a bit of help"* excursion to those preparing a sprawling, highest-tier, long-term basecamp, we've got you covered.

Inspired by "care package" mods from begginfokillz and CrypticXenon, this opens a whole new world of granular, customized packages with all the essentials. Please be sure to read [the full description](https://github.com/ckdextergames/Icarus_mods/blob/HTGR/DETAILS.md) for important information, and good hunting!

These packages come in six varieties, with increasing benefits and increasing cost. They replace six of the workshop's seed packs. To use: Simply research (if needed), purchase, and "consume" while on the surface. Note: Packages 2-6 contain packs within them which must be opened separately.

**IMPORTANT WARNING**: Make certain you have enough slots in your personal inventory to accomodate all the items in the pack you're buying! The packages have too many items for most player's inventory. So it is **highly recommend** to make sure you have **plenty of free inventory space**, open one sub-package at a time, then store them in a chest or cupboard to make room in your inventory. Once your inventory is freed up, then open the next sub-package. Some packs have *dozens of items*, so plan accordingly!

__Prototype Preservation Crate__

The internally-powered Prototype Preservation Crate (from the Oasis: Angler mission) is now available for research and purchase in the Orbital Workshop.

__Workshop Furnaces__

Two new varieties of MXC Furnace. The Intermediate one smelts like a Concrete Stove, the Advanced like Electric. They cost more also.

__The Theseus "Omniburst" Series__

Available for New Frontiers only: The knife, spear, arrows, and bolts in this series combine and improve on the attributes of all similar Prometheus-grade workshop items. Much more expensive to research and craft, but well worth the cost.
