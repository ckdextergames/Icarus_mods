__Prefab_Base_Kits__

Adapting and updating Pr0f23ss0r's original Base Kits mod, here's two new versions (choose one, they aren't compatible with each other). They replace the berry seed pack and cost more. Cuz, my friend, you can just go pick some berries. LOL. To use: just research, buy, and "consume" when on the surface. Then voila, you have all the needed items in your inventory. They come in five varieties:

A. Concrete Prefab base kit: Everything needed for a strudy, bare-bones, storm-defying concrete 2X6.

B. Cozy Cabin Prefab kit: Everything needed for a small but functional 2X3 stone hunting cabin (including a front porch for watching the sunset and growing a few essential crops).

C. The Big Concrete Prefab kit: Everything needed for a larger concrete base. Somewhat pricer, but still just the building materials.

D. The Big Stone Prefab kit: A more expensive package, this contains everything needed for larger stone hunting cabin (including a front porch for watching the sunset and growing a few essential crops).

E. The Team Basecamp Prefab kit: A **much** more expensive package, this contains everything needed for a much larger 2-story concrete base, with an adjacent 2X2 greenhouse. **NOTE**: The glass pieces of this greenhouse will take storm damage. They will need to be repaired, and ideally replaced with pieces you craft yourself using the "Reinforced Glass" buff, by crafting in the Glassworking Bench with an active water connection.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change these json files: "D_ItemStatic", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_WorkshopItems", "D_Consumable", and "D_Itemable". Or, use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
