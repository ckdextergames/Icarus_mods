README:

__One_Hit_Wonder__

Wishing that the __"Peerless Lumberjack"__ and __"Lucky Strike"__ talents gave you a much higher chance of chopping that tree or mining that voxel in just one hit? Wish no more, dear prospector. The One_Hit_Wonder mod is availaible in 10%, 25%, 50%, and 65% flavors.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Talents.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
