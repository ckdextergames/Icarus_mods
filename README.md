Compatible with Icarus Week 76 update:

<a name="mod">__Creature Chaos!__</a>

Expanding on CriticalFail's original "Moar_Bearz" mod, I'm moving beyond my "So_Many_Bearz" mod to encompass all the different carnivorous varmints throughout both Olympus and Styx. This mod comes in four flavors, of increasing intensity.

* Level 1 just marginally ups the count of aggressive critters all around so you'll notice, but not be overwhelved.
* Level 2 provides some real challenges in dealing with the increased spawning in each biome you enter.
* Level 3 -- Be prepared. There can be TONS of crazed quadrupeds ready to attack at every turn. Y'all been warned.
* A new version of CreatureChaos - Level 4! Aggressive creatures have more health, move faster, their perception radius is increased, and __even more__ of them spawn.

Notes:

A. This mod only impacts Hard Mode, in missions and open world. I don't recommend using this mod for playing any other level.

B. This mod does seem to have some impact on Horde Mode waves, but was not designed for Horde Mode specifically. For that, I'd suggest Semac's mods or other's mods designed to alter Horde Mode.

C. Increased spawns may not appear right away. You may need to move around until you come across them.

D. Yes, especially for level 3 and 4, there may be some bears spawning in trees. Enjoy.

Good hunting!
