2. <a name="2">Crafting speeds:</a>

__SpeedyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDspeedy)

Everything that already crafts fast in vanilla stays that fast. But all the longer crafting times are reduced to be slightly less than the "default" speed (the same speed as iron ingots or gunpowder).

__CrazyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcrazy)

Nearly everything crafts way faster (like, crazyfast).

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. Mod Manager highly recommended: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software

3. <a name="3">__Toughest Hedgehogs__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDhogs)

***Note: NOT UPDATED. With the addition of vanilla fortifications, I may no longer be updating this mod. As of week 49, the Toughest Hedgehogs mod works fine. However, more investigation is required on why it's breaking the sitting-in-chairs game mechanic when combined with other mods, even when all it's json files are updated to the current week. I'll announce on the discord if/when it's been fixed***

Hedgehogs which look just like the normal "Medium Wood Hedgehog" but are **40X** more durable and cause **5X** damage. Crafting requires additional materials.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ItemsStatic.json", "D_Alterations" & "D_ProcessorRecipes"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

4. <a name="4">__Superdeluxe Combo__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcombo)

This all-in-one package integrates the following:

* The expansive WZG Icarus-balance-overhaul mod, tweaked thusly:
   * Rope from fiber can be crafted on the Character in addition to the Crafting Bench (as of week 57 update)
   * Workshop repair kits can be crafted in the Fabricator (as of week 57 update)
   * The Larkwell Beta bakcpack has higher stats (more slots, reduced carry weights, increased ammo capacity and reload speed for rifles, etc) 
   * Much higher chances to mine a voxel in one swing and harvest a tree with one chop
   * More food buff slots
   * The MXC furnace smelts like an electric furnace
   * The Larkwell arrow and crossbow bolt bundles contain 50, not 25 per pack
   * Crumbed Fish is a "powerfood," giving 200 max health and stamina, and 30% stamina regeneration. Slightly increased recipe requirements. 
* JimK72's Custom_Puck_Lights and Camera_Distance mods (as-is)
* Critfail's Pneu_B_Gone (as-is)
* An enhanced versions of CritFail's WasteNot_All (higher chance for more exotics)

*__CAUTION:__* Intended as a unique modpack -- it confilcts with other mods. If you intend to use this mod with any other mods, you'll for sure need to use [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) to choose options and merge.

5. <a name="5">__So_Many_Bearz__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbearz)

*Note: Not being updated. I suggest instead using one of my [Creature Chaos](#12) mods*. Looking for a challenge? This adaptation of CritFail's *MoarBearz* mod turns up the volume. A lot. Beware! *MoarBearz* keeps the in-game distance they can spawn from your dropship. This mod decreases that distance __by half__! *MoarBearz* increases the possible spawning of bears, polar bears and mammoths from 1 to 3, while this mods __cranks that up to 7__. So yeah, be warned. And be ready! Enjoy.

6. <a name="6">__Revised Icarus Statues__: two varieties!</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDstatues)

__NoGold_Statue__

This mod makes the Icarus Statue easier to craft by removing the requirement for refined gold and replacing it with oxite. Still crafted at the Rustic bench.

__T4_Statue__

This mod turns the Icarus Statue into a late-game prize to be displayed with pride. :) It must be crafted at the fabricator and the recipe requires a wholloping crapton of various T2, T3, and T4 materials.

*__CAUTION__*: These mods may conflict with other mods! (And obvi can't be used together...) Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

7. <a name="7">__All_The_Poison_Fish!__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDpoisonfish)

__All_The_Poison_Fish!__

Going the opposite direction of JimK72's great No_Poison_Fish mod, this one makes __ALL the fish that spawn__ the aggressive ones, and there's triple the number of them! __CAUTION:__ With this mod installed, swimming and fishing in lakes works fine and you can catch a lot of fish (bring an anti-poison buff, you are more likely to get bit!) However, it is __*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*__ that you do not swim or try to catch fish in any of the narrow rivers. Theree will be way too many of them coming at you at once which could impact game performance, and is highly likely to make you __somewhat dead very fast__. Y'all been warned.

8. <a name="8">__MaxiStax__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDmaxistax)

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are on the download page.

9. <a name="9">__One_Hit_Wonder__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDonehit)

Wishing that the __"Peerless Lumberjack"__ and __"Lucky Strike"__ talents gave you a much higher chance of chopping that tree or mining that voxel in just one hit? Wish no more, dear prospector. The One_Hit_Wonder mod is availaible in 10%, 25%, 50%, and 65% flavors.

10. <a name="10">__Prefab_Base_Kit__</a> (Direct link: http://bit.ly/CKDprefabs)

Adapting and updating Pr0f23ss0r's original Base Kits mod, here's two new versions (choose one, they aren't compatible with each other). They replace the berry seed pack and cost more. Cuz, my friend, you can just go pick some berries. LOL. To use: just "consume" when on the surface and voila, you have all the needed items.

A. Concrete Prefab base kit: Everything needed for a strudy, bare-bones, storm-defying concrete 2X6.

B. Cozy Cabin Prefab kit: Everything needed for a small but functional 2X3 stone hunting cabin (including a front porch for watching the sunset and growing a few essential crops).

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change these json files: "D_ItemStatic", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_WorkshopItems", "D_Consumable", and "D_Itemable".

11. <a name="11">__The Bifrost Titanium Crossbow__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbifrost)

The Bifrost is a weapon of unparalled power and speed. While it requires more resources to craft, it hits harder and has a much higher ammo capacity. (This mod replaces the vanilla Titanium Crossbow, crafted in the Fabricator, with this more expensive and powerful version.)

"Not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."

12. <a name="12">__Creature Chaos!__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcritters)

Expanding on CriticalFail's original "Moar_Bearz" mod, I'm moving beyond my "So_Many_Bearz" mod to encompass all the different carnivorous varmints throughout both Olympus and Styx. This mod comes in three flavors, of increasing intensity (labeled LVL 1, 2, and 3).

Level 1 just marginally ups the count of aggressive critters all around so you'll notice, but not be overwhelved.

Level 2 provides some real challenges in dealing with the increased spawning in each biome you enter.

Level 3? Ha! You can't handle level 3... Seriously, be prepared. There can be TONS of crazed quadrupeds ready to attack at every turn. Ya been warned.

__Notes__:

A. This mod only impacts Hard Mode prospects and open world. If there's a lot of popular demand, I could consider making different versions for medium or super hard, but for now, it's just for Hard. I don't recommend using this mod for playing any other level.

B. This mod doesn't specifically alter Horde Mode waves. For that, I'd suggest Semac's mods or other's mods designed to alter Horde Mode.

C. Increased spawns may not appear right away. You may need to move around until you come across them.

D. Yes, especially for level 3, there may be some bears spawning in trees or walking in air. Enjoy.

Good hunting!

13. <a name="13">__Better Carts__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbettercarts)

Three new versions of the buffalo cart:

The "Terrier":
* Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 3000 and no speed loss
* Same recipie, but slightly increased crafting cost
  
The "Ridgeback":
* Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 5000 and slight speed gain
* Increased crafting cost, also requires steel screws instead of iron nails
  
The "Mastiff":
* Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 8000 and speed bumped by 40%
* Increased crafting cost, requires steel screws, steel rebar, and carbon fiber 

(Obviously, these are mutually exclusive mods. Choose one variety.)

14. <a name="14">__Hearty Meat & Veggie Stew__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDstew)

To fight the cold and be pepared for the hunt, prepare this apex dish! Adapted for Icarus from an old family recipe, this chunky stew boosts health and stamina, regeneration, and more. While it's harder to prepare, doing so is worth its many benefits.

"That stuff's expensive as hell, but basically gives you superpowers!" --Sol

This mod replaces the "Stew" item, and can only be crafted in the electric and biodiesel stoves, not the potbelly stove.
