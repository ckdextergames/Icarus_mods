<a name="mod">__Enhanced Combo Suit Module: "The Panther Mark 2"__</a>

Costing quite a bit more to research and purchase, this powerful suit module replaces the "Patcher I" and combines characteristics of multiple modules:

A more powerful and *__mutually exlusive__* version of the Panther suit module, this incorporates the *What is This* talent (for a chance of exotics when mining metals) and reivies the *Gifts of Tartarus* from CritFail, removing cave sickness.

* Increases speed by 30%
* Adds 12 additional inventory slots
* Provides 100% fall damage resistance
* Increases weight capacity ten-fold over the vanilla "Adlift" suit module
* Chance of exotics when mining metals
* No more pneumonia

*"They say the best things in life are free. This must not be one of them" -- Sol*
