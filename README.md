Compatible with Icarus Week 67 update:

<a name="mod">__Hearty Meat & Veggie Stew__</a>

To fight the cold and be prepared for the hunt, prepare this apex dish! Adapted for Icarus from an old family recipe, this chunky stew boosts health and stamina, regeneration, and more. While it's harder to prepare, doing so is worth its many benefits.

*"That stuff's expensive as hell, but basically gives you superpowers!"* --Sol

This mod replaces the "Stew" item, and can only be crafted in the electric and biodiesel stoves, not the potbelly stove.
