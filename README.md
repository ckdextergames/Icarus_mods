*__Dextermods__*: mods for Icarus by CK_Dexterhaven

__Creature Chaos!__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcritters)

Expanding on CriticalFail's original "Moar_Bearz" mod, I'm moving beyond my "So_Many_Bearz" mod to encompass all the different carnivorous varmits throughout both Olympus and Styx. This mod comes in three flavors, of increasing intensity (labeled LVL 1, 2, and 3).

* Level 1 just marginally ups the count of agressive critters all around so you'll notice, but not be overwhelved.
* Level 2 provides some real challenges in dealing with the increased spawning in each biome you enter.
* Level 3? Ha! You can't handle level 3... Seriously, be prepared. There will be TONS of crazed quadrapeds ready to attack at every turn. Y'all been warned.

Notes:

A. This mod only impacts Hard Mode prospects and open world. If there's a lot of popular demand, I could consider making different versions for medium or super hard, but for now, it's just for Hard. I don't recommend using this mod for playing any other level.

B. This mod doesn't specifically alter Horde Mode waves. For that, I'd suggest Semac's mods.

C. Yes, especially for level 3, there may be some bears spawning in trees. Enjoy.

Good hunting!

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change these json files: "D_AISpawnRules", "D_AISpawnZones", and "D_AIAutonomousSpawns". Or, use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
