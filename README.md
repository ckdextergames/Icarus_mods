*__Welcome to Dextermods__*: Mods for Icarus by CK_Dexterhaven

__Hearty Meat & Veggie Stew__

To fight the cold and be pepared for the hunt, prepare this apex dish! Adapted for Icarus from an old family recipie, this chunky stew boosts health and stamina, regeneration, and more. While it's harder to prepare, doing so is worth its many benefits.

"That stuff's expensive as hell, but basically gives you superpowers!" --Sol

This mod replaces the "Stew" item, and can only be crafted in the electric and biodiesel stoves, not the potbelly stove.

*__CAUTION__:* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ModifierStates.json", "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_Consumable", and "D_Itemable", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
