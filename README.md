*Compatible with Icarus Week 82 update, or the current later game build if updated with Icarus Mod Manager.*

<a name="mod">__Hit the Ground Running__</a>

Brought to you by DexterHaven Outfitters LTD, these Icarus Starter Packs and Prefabs contain everything a prospector needs to get started on the surface. From the bare-bones, *"I just need a bit of help"* excursion to those preparing a sprawling, highest-tier, long-term basecamp, we've got you covered.

Inspired by "care package" mods from begginfokillz and CrypticXenon, this opens a whole new world of granular, customized packages with all the essentials. Please be sure to read [the full description](https://github.com/ckdextergames/Icarus_mods/blob/HTGR/DETAILS.md) for important information, and good hunting!

These packages come in six varieties, with increasing benefits and increasing cost. They replace six of the workshop's seed packs. To use: Simply research (if needed), purchase, and "consume" while on the surface. Note: Packages 2-6 contain packs within them which must be opened separately.

**IMPORTANT WARNING**: Make certain you have enough slots in your personal inventory to accomodate all the items in the pack you're buying! The packages have too many items for most player's inventory. So it is **highly recommend** to make sure you have **plenty of free inventory space**, open one sub-package at a time, then store them in a chest or cupboard to make room in your inventory. Once your inventory is freed up, then open the next sub-package. Some packs have *dozens of items*, so plan accordingly!

**Note**: If you already had some seed packs used in this mod in your orbital or planetry inventory, those will now be the corresponding Starter Pack, but they will revert to the seed pack if the mod is no longer installed.
