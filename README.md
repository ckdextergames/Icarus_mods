Three new versions of the buffalo cart -- all make cargo saddles rideable:

The "Terrier":
- Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 3000 and no speed loss
- Heavy cargo slots increased from 5 to 8
- Same recipie, but slightly increased crafting cost
  
The "Ridgeback":
-  Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 5000 and slight speed gain
- Heavy cargo slots increased from 5 to 10
- Increased crafting cost, also requires steel screws instead of iron nails
  
The "Mastiff":
- Weight capacity increased from 1000 to 8000 and speed bumped by 40%
- Heavy cargo slots increased from 5 to 12
- Increased crafting cost, requires steel screws, steel rebar, and carbon fiber 

(Obviously, these are mutually exclusive mods. Choose one variety.)

H/T to Unaffected for the insight to make them rideable.
