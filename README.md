<a name="mod">__JimK Innovations__</a>

With this mod, you can research and buy three essential (and amazing!) JimK items in their own dedicated Orbital Workshop section, "JimK Innovations". This way, they don't replace other existing workshop items, making those still available. The prices are set according to their relative power / utility and require both REN and purple (but no red) exotics.

<a name="warnings">*__WARNINGS:__*</a>

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.
