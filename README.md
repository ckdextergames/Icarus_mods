2. <a name="2">Crafting speeds:</a>

__SpeedyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDspeedy)

Everything that already crafts fast in vanilla stays that fast. But all the longer crafting times are reduced to be slightly less than the "default" speed (the same speed as iron ingots or gunpowder).

__CrazyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcrazy)

Nearly everything crafts way faster (like, crazyfast).

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. Mod Manager highly recommended: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

3. <a name="3">__Superdeluxe Combo__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcombo)

This all-in-one package integrates the following:

* The expansive WZG Icarus-balance-overhaul mod, tweaked thusly:
   * Rope from fiber can be crafted on the Character in addition to the Crafting Bench
   * Workshop repair kits can be crafted in the Fabricator
   * The Larkwell Beta bakcpack has higher stats (more slots, reduced carry weights, increased ammo capacity and reload speed for rifles, etc) 
		-- ***NOTE:*** This enhanced bakcpack has been removed from SuperDeluxe and is now its own mod (see the [Tactical Backpack](#18) mod below)
   * Much higher chances to mine a voxel in one swing and harvest a tree with one chop
   * More food buff slots
   * The MXC furnace smelts like an electric furnace
   * The Larkwell arrow and crossbow bolt bundles contain 50, not 25 per pack
   * The Crumbed Saltwater Fish Filet is a "powerfood," giving 200 max health and stamina, and 30% stamina regeneration. Slightly increased recipe requirements. 
* JimK72's Custom_Puck_Lights and Camera_Distance mods (as-is)
* Critfail's "Blessing of Tartarus" mod (as-is)
* An enhanced versions of CritFail's WasteNot_All (higher chance for more exotics)

*__CAUTIONS:__*

* Intended as a unique modpack -- it confilcts with other mods. If you intend to use this mod with any other mods, you'll for sure need to use [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) to choose options and merge.
* This mod changes stack sizes. Be warned that if you use this mod, and then use no mods or different mods during a prospect or in the same Open World/Outpost, you will likely lose some or even all inventory. It is best to stay with one stack-size-changing mod for a given prospect or Open World.

4. <a name="4">__Revised Icarus Statues__: two varieties!</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDstatues)

__NoGold_Statue__

This mod makes the Icarus Statue easier to craft by removing the requirement for refined gold and replacing it with oxite. Still crafted at the Rustic bench.

__T4_Statue__

This mod turns the Icarus Statue into a late-game prize to be displayed with pride. :) It must be crafted at the fabricator and the recipe requires a wholloping crapton of various T2, T3, and T4 materials.

*__CAUTION__*: These mods may conflict with other mods! (And obvi can't be used together...) Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.  [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

5. <a name="5">__All_The_Poison_Fish!__</a>

__All_The_Poison_Fish!__

***Attention - As of the Galileo update, until further notice, this mod is no longer in use or downloadable.***

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

6. <a name="6">__MaxiStax__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDmaxistax)

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are on the download page.

* __Caution__: This mod changes stack sizes. Be warned that if you use this mod, and then use no mods or different mods during a prospect or in the same Open World/Outpost, you will likely lose some or even all inventory. It is best to stay with one stack-size-changing mod for a given prospect or Open World.

7. <a name="7">__One_Hit_Wonder__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDonehit)

Wishing that the __"Peerless Lumberjack"__ and __"Lucky Strike"__ talents gave you a much higher chance of chopping that tree or mining that voxel in just one hit? Wish no more, dear prospector. The One_Hit_Wonder mod is availaible in 10%, 25%, 50%, and 65% flavors.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Talents.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

8. __Prefab_Base_Kits__

THIS MOD IS NO LONGER IN USE. I suggest instead using [Hit the Ground Running](#36)

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

9. <a name="9">__The Bifrost Titanium Crossbow__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbifrost)

The Bifrost is a weapon of unparalled power and speed. While it requires more resources to craft, it hits harder and has a much higher ammo capacity. (This mod replaces the vanilla Titanium Crossbow, crafted in the Fabricator, with this more expensive and powerful version.)

"Not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change these json files: "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_ItemStatic", "D_FirearmData", and "D_Itemable". Or, use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

10. <a name="10">__Creature Chaos!__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcritters)

Expanding on CriticalFail's original "Moar_Bearz" mod, I'm moving beyond my "So_Many_Bearz" mod to encompass all the different carnivorous varmints throughout both Olympus and Styx. This mod comes in four flavors, of increasing intensity.

This mod increases the count and intensity of aggressive animals. Please see the full details before use!

11. <a name="11">__Better Carts__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbettercarts)

Three new versions of the buffalo cart! See mod page for full details.

(Obviously, these are mutually exclusive mods. Choose one variety.)

*__CAUTION__:* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Equippable.json", "D_ProcessorRecipes", and "D_Itemable", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

12. <a name="12">__Hearty Meat & Veggie Stew__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDstew)

To fight the cold and be pepared for the hunt, prepare this apex dish! Adapted for Icarus from an old family recipe, this chunky stew boosts health and stamina, regeneration, and more. While it's harder to prepare, doing so is worth its many benefits.

"That stuff's expensive as hell, but basically gives you superpowers!" --Sol

This mod replaces the "Stew" item, and can only be crafted in the electric and biodiesel stoves, not the potbelly stove.

*__CAUTION__:* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ModifierStates.json", "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_Consumable", and "D_Itemable", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

13. <a name="13">__EPS: Enzyme Power Smoothies__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDeps)

Blended in the Kitchen Bench or Advanced Kitchen Bench in one these 5 "delicious" varieties, these elixirs pack a punch:

Health Jolt, Stamina Jolt, Fall Damage Protection, Speed Jolt, and EPS 2.0 "OmniBoost"

*__CAUTION__:* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ModifierStates.json", "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_ItemStatic", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_Consumable", "D_Meshable", and "D_Itemable", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

-- [*__Return to mod list__*](#modlist)

---

14. <a name="14">__The Sinotai Extreme Spikewall!__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDspikes)

Replacing the vanilla Spike Fortifications, these new Spikes require much higher-tier materials to craft (refined wood, steel ingots and screws, carbon fiber, exotics, and rope). However, they have __8 times__ the durability of vanilla spikes.

*Hold the line, prospector... Hold. The. Line!*

*__CAUTION__:* * This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ItemsStatic.json", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_Itemable", "D_Durable" & "D_ProcessorRecipes"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.

*__Note:__ This mod is available for download, but will no longer be updated. Suggest instead using [Dexterhaven Labs](#40), since its content is included in that mod.*

18. <a name="18">__Enhanced Tactical Backpack__</a> (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbackpack)

This enhanced version of the Larkwell-Martinez Tactical Backpack has many powerful features. That power? It's gonna cost ya 5X the regular price. Still, given these stats, that's a bargain!

* Increases reload speed of bows, crossbows, and rifles by 85%

Highest-tier armor which combines or improves on features of most other armor sets. Upgrades your already-crafted HDP Composite armor with exotics and platinum weave for the strongest, most versitle protection available. Note that the Artemis helmet requires microcontrollers for diagnostics and dynamic stabilization of the exotic field.

Brought to you by JimK72 & CK_Dexterhaven, the Mini Refrigerator! Crafted as an additional option in the Fabricator, this fridge requires a bit less than half the materials as the regular fridge, and holds somewhat less. Otherwise, functions just the same. Enjoy!

Even with the most intense storms, you can now keep all those trees. With this mod written by Lesley64 installed, you'll enjoy no more forest fires. Neither fire arrows, torches, nor lightning storms will cause trees to burn.
