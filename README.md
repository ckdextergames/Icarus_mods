__The Bifrost Titanium Crossbow__

The Bifrost is a weapon of unparalled power and speed. While it requires more resources to craft, it hits harder and has a much higher ammo capacity.
"Not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change these json files: "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_ItemStatic", "D_FirearmData", and "D_Itemable". Or, use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
