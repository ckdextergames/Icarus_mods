<a name="mod">__Creature Chaos!__</a>

Expanding on CriticalFail's original "Moar_Bearz" mod, this mod increases the spawn rates for aggressive creatures (plus a few not super-aggressive ones such as boar and mammoth). This mod comes in two flavors: "LOW" and "HI".

Notes:

A. This mod impacts all biomes on Olympus, Styx, Prometheus, and Outposts and works in both missions and open world.

B. This mod does seem to have some impact on Horde Mode waves, but was not designed for Horde Mode specifically. For that, I'd suggest Semac's mods or other's mods designed to alter Horde Mode.

C. Increased spawns may not appear right away. You may need to move around and wait a bit until you come across them.

D. Choose one variety: "LOW" or "HI". Each is compatible with both varieties of "Tuff Critters"

Good hunting!
