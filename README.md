<a name="mod">__Enhanced Combo Suit Module: "The Panther"__</a>

Costing quite a bit more to research and purchase, this powerful suit module replaces the "Patcher I" and combines characteristics of multiple modules:

* Increases speed by 60%
* Adds 12 additional inventory slots
* Provides 100% fall damage resistance
* Increases weight capacity ten-fold over the vanilla "Adlift" suit module

*"They say the best things in life are free. This must not be one of them" -- Sol*
