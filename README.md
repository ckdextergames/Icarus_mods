*__Dextermods__*: mods for Icarus by CK_Dexterhaven

__MaxiStax__

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are below.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Itemable.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. Mod Manager highly recommended: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software
