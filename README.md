# Icarus_mods
*__Dextermods__*: mods for Icarus by CK_Dexterhaven

__NoGold_Statue__

This mod makes the Icarus Statue easier to craft by removing the requirement for refined gold and replacing it with oxite. Still crafted at the Rustic bench.

__T4_Statue__

This mod turns the Icarus Statue into a late-game prize to be displayed with pride. :) It must be crafted at the fabricator and the recipe requires a wholloping crapton of various T2, T3, and T4 materials.

*__CAUTION__*: These mods may conflict with other mods! (And obvi can't be used together...) Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. Mod Manager highly recommended: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software
