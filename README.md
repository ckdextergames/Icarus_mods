*__CAUTION__:* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Equippable.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

2. Crafting speeds:

__SpeedyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDspeedy)

Everything that already crafts fast in vanilla stays that fast. But all the longer crafting times are reduced to be slightly less than the "default" speed (the same speed as iron ingots or gunpowder).

__CrazyCrafter__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcrazy)

Nearly everything crafts way faster (like, crazyfast).

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. Mod Manager highly recommended: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software

---

3. __Toughest Hedgehogs__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDhogs)

Hedgehogs which look just like the normal "Medium Wood Hedgehog" but are **40X** more durable and cause **5X** damage. Crafting requires additional materials.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ItemsStatic.json", "D_Alterations" & "D_ProcessorRecipes"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.  [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

4. __Superdeluxe Combo__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcombo)

This all-in-one package encompasses all three mods above (including the Bananapants version of Suit Modules), but also integrates the following:

* Floof_ModifiedLevelignMod (as-is)
* The expansive WZG Icarus-balance-overhaul mod, tweaked thusly:
   * The Larkwell Beta bakcpack has higher stats (more slots, reduced carry weights, increased ammo capacity and reload speed for rifles, etc) 
   * Much higher chances to mine a voxel in one swing and harvest a tree with one chop
   * More food buff slots
   * The MXC furnace smelts like an electric furnace
   * The Larkwell arrow and bolt bundles contain 50, not 25 per pack (the onscreen description still says 25 but they contain 50)
   * Crumbed Fish is a "powerfood," giving 200 max health and stamina, and 30% stamina regeneration. Slightly increased recipe requirements. 
* JimK72's Windmill_Generator, Jimk_900_Jump, Custom_Puck_Lights, and Camera_Distance mods (as-is)
* Critfail's Pneu_B_Gone (as-is)
* An enhanced versions of CritFail's WasteNot_All (higher chance for more exotics)

*__CAUTION:__* Intended as a stand-alone modpack and confilcts with other mods. If you intend to use this mod with any other mods, you'll for sure need to use [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) to choose options and merge.

5. __So_Many_Bearz__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDbearz)

Looking for a challenge? This adaptation of CritFail's *MoarBearz* mod turns up the volume. A lot. Beware! *MoarBearz* keeps the in-game distance they can spawn from your dropship. This mod decreases that distance __by half__! *MoarBearz* increases the possible spawning of bears, polar bears and mammoths from 1 to 3, while this mods __cranks that up to 7__. So yeah, be warned. And be ready! Enjoy.

---

6. __Revised Icarus Statues__: two varieties! (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDstatues)

__NoGold_Statue__

This mod makes the Icarus Statue easier to craft by removing the requirement for refined gold and replacing it with oxite. Still crafted at the Rustic bench.

__T4_Statue__

This mod turns the Icarus Statue into a late-game prize to be displayed with pride. :) It must be crafted at the fabricator and the recipe requires a wholloping crapton of various T2, T3, and T4 materials.

*__CAUTION__*: These mods may conflict with other mods! (And obvi can't be used together...) Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.  [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!

---

7. __All_The_Poison_Fish!__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDpoisonfish)

Going the opposite direction of JimK72's great No_Poison_Fish mod, this one makes __ALL the fish that spawn__ the aggressive ones, and there's triple the number of them! __CAUTION:__ With this mod installed, swimming and fishing in lakes works fine and you can catch a lot of fish (bring an anti-poison buff, you are more likely to get bit!) However, it is __*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*__ that you do not swim or try to catch fish in any of the narrow rivers. Theree will be way too many of them coming at you at once which could impact game performance, and is highly likely to make you __somewhat dead very fast__. Y'all been warned.

---

8. __MaxiStax__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDmaxistax)

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are on the download page.

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Itemable.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
