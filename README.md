<a name="warnings">*__WARNINGS:__*</a>

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.

---
