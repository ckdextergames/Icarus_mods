# Icarus_mods
*__Dextermods__*: mods for Icarus by CK_Dexterhaven

__Superdeluxe Combo__ (Direct link: https://bit.ly/CKDcombo)

This all-in-one package encompasses all three mods above (including the Bananapants version of Suit Modules), but also integrates the following:

* Floof_ModifiedLevelignMod (as-is)
* The expansive WZG Icarus-balance-overhaul mod, tweaked thusly:
   * The Larkwell Beta bakcpack has higher stats (more slots, reduced carry weights, increased ammo capacity and reload speed for rifles, etc) 
   * Much higher chances to mine a voxel in one swing and harvest a tree with one chop
   * More food buff slots
   * The MXC furnace smelts like an electric furnace
   * The Larkwell arrow bundles contain 50, not 25 per pack
   * Crumbed Fish is a "powerfood," giving 200 max health and stamina, and 30% stamina regeneration. Slightly increased recipe requirements. 
* JimK72's Custom_Puck_Lights and Camera_Distance mods (as-is)
* Critfail's Pneu_B_Gone (as-is)
* An enhanced versions of CritFail's WasteNot_All (higher chance for more exotics)

*__CAUTION:__* Intended as a unique modpack -- it will confilct with other mods. If you intend to use this mod with any other mods, you'll for sure need to use Mod Manager to choose options and merge. https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software
