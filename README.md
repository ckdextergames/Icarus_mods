Compatible with Icarus Week 71 update:

<a name="mod">__The Sinotai Extreme Spikewall!__</a>

Replacing the vanilla Spike Fortifications, these new Spikes require much higher-tier materials to craft (refined wood, steel ingots and screws, carbon fiber, exotics, and rope). However, they have __8 times__ the durability of vanilla spikes.

They are crafted in the Machining Bench, not the Crafting Bench.

*Hold the line, prospector... Hold. The. Line!*

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ItemsStatic.json", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_Itemable", "D_Durable" & "D_ProcessorRecipes"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.
