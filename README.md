<a name="mod">__MiniFridge__</a>

Brought to you by JimK72 & CK_Dexterhaven, the Mini Refrigerator! Crafted as an additional option in the Fabricator, this fridge requires a bit less than half the materials as the regular fridge, and holds somewhat less. Otherwise, functions just the same. Enjoy!

*"Perfect for any Icarus dorm or workshop"*
