<a name="mod">__Finally No Fckn Forest Fires__</a>

Thanks to Lesley64, this mod ***removes*** forset fire from the game. Storms, fire arrows, torches? Nope. Trees don't catch fire anymore.

<a name="warnings">*__WARNINGS:__*</a>

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.
