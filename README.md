<a name="mod">__Starter Packs__</a>

Brought to you by DexterHaven Outfitters LTD, these Icarus Starter Packs contain everything a prospector needs to get started on the surface. From the bare-bones, *"I just need a bit of help"* excursion to those preparing a sprawling, highest-tier, long-term basecamp, we've got you covered.

Inspired by "care package" mods from begginfokillz and CrypticXenon, this opens a whole new world of granular, customized packages with all the essentials. Please be sure to read [the full description](https://github.com/ckdextergames/Icarus_mods/blob/StarterPacks/DETAILS.md) for important information, and good hunting!
 
Starter packs come in 9 levels of increasing benefits and increasing cost. They replace all of the workshop's seed packs, but each level includes a stack of the corresponding food, and successive higher levels include all the previous level's food items as well (plus, the highest levels include extra foods for which there are no seed packs). To use: Simply research (if needed), purchase, and "consume" while on the surface.

**IMPORTANT WARNING**: Make certain you have enough slots in your personal inventory to accomodate all the items in the pack you're buying! All items expand into your personal inventory when you select "Consume". So --especially for higher level Starter Packs-- you'll likely need suit modules and a high-capacity backpack, and/or be using modded versions to get the number of inventory slots required. The level 1 pack has 16 items, and the level 9 pack has *64 items*, so plan accordingly!

**Notes**:

1. There are some types of items that are not included in these starter packs. These are items that are either very much subject to personal taste, or they can be crafted with much greater benefits/capacities by a player with corresponding talents for that item. They include:
- Building pieces
- Armor
- Firearms, ammo, & arrows
- Food items
- Storage crates
2. If you already had some seed packs in your orbital or planetry inventory, those will now be the corresponding Starter Pack, but they will revert to the seed pack if the mod is no longer installed.
3. Note that any orbital Workshop items included in these packs work like regular planet-crafted items -- they won't be "assigned" to your character, since that character didn't **buy** them in the Workshop. So whether you use them on a mission or Open World, they ain't comin back.
