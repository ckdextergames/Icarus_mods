<a name="mod">__MaxiStax__</a>

*Per galactic law, beer and wine come in twelve packs. No way I'm messing with that s**t"* -- CK Dexterhaven

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are below.

__Stack size changes:__

* Fiber 200 >> 1000
* Stone 100 >> 400
* Wood 100 >> 800
* Stick 100 >> 1000
* Sulfur 50 >> 400
* Berries 100 >> 400
* Iron ore 50 >> 500
* Iron ingot 20 >> 400

* Glass 20 >> 400
