__Prefab_Base_Kits__ (Direct link: http://bit.ly/CKDprefabs)

Adapting and updating Pr0f23ss0r's original Base Kits mod, here's two new versions (choose one, they aren't compatible with each other). They replace the berry seed pack and cost more. Cuz, my friend, you can just go pick some berries. LOL. To use: just "consume" when on the surface and voila, you have all the needed items.

A. Concrete Prefab base kit: Everything needed for a strudy, bare-bones, storm-defying concrete 2X6.

B. Cozy Cabin Prefab kit: Everything needed for a small but functional 2X3 stone hunting cabin (including a front porch for watching the sunset and growing a few essential crops).

*__CAUTION__*: This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_Talents.json", or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes. [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) highly recommended!
