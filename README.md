<a name="mod">__The Bifrost Titanium Crossbow__</a>

The Bifrost is truly a weapon of unparalled power and speed. While it requires more resources to craft, it hits harder and has a much higher ammo capacity. (This mod replaces the vanilla Titanium Crossbow, crafted in the Fabricator, with this more expensive and powerful version.)

*"Not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."*
