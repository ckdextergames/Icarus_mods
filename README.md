<a name="mod">__4x Reds__</a>

With this mod installed:
- All four of the Prometheus "Exploration" missions will have 4 times the number of exotic spawn points as in vanilla (this includes both purple and red, there's no way to separate them, so there's just a higher chance of more reds to occur along with purples).
- Any red exotic sites that spawn will yield 4 times the number of exotics as in vanilla.
