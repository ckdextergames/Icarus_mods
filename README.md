Compatible with Icarus Week 71 update:

<a name="mod">__No Weather__</a>

Thanks to JimK72, laanp, Durzo (and h/t to Crystal), this mod ***removes*** all weather events from the game. No wind, rain, snow, sand, etc. No storms of any kind.

<a name="warnings">*__WARNINGS:__*</a>

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_WeatherEvents" and "D_ProspectForecast"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.

<a name="install">__Installation:__</a>

* See the warning above regarding placing multiple mods in this folder! [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
