<a name="mod">__MaxiStax__</a>

*Per galactic law, beer and wine come in twelve packs. No way I'm messing with that s**t"* -- CK Dexterhaven

This mod was designed to help move a large base a short distance without having to fuss with lots of individual stacks. Mods like WZG and others increase stack sizes for __many__ different items, and in some cases by a lot. With this mod, I wanted to take that a step further. By merging this mod with one like WZG I can take advantage of those larger stack sizes already there, and then bump up some key ones by a lot more, thus making a move a bunch easier. Complete details of stack size changes are below.

* __Caution__: This mod changes stack sizes. Be warned that if you use this mod, and then use no mods or different mods during a prospect or in the same Open World/Outpost, you will likely lose some or even all inventory. It is best to stay with one stack-size-changing mod for a given prospect or Open World.
