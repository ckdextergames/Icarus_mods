<a name="mod">__The T3 Elevator__</a>

This is a revised version of the **Elevator** mod made by JimK72. Instead of being crafted on the character, this is crafted at the Machining Bench, and requires steel, rope, Carbon Fiber, and an aluminum floor piece.

<a name="warnings">*__WARNINGS:__*</a>

* This mod may conflict with other mods! Recommended to use alone, or with mods known not to change "D_ProcessorRecipes", "D_DeployableSetup", "D_ItemsStatic", "D_ItemTemplate", "D_Deployable", "D_Itemable", and "D_Meshable"; or use Mod Manager to choose your desired changes.
* Instead of placing mods in your mod folder, using [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
* Playing with others who aren't using the the exact same mod file(s), or any mods, could cause errors, crashes, and/or inventory loss.

---

<a name="install">__Installation:__</a>

* Go to \Icarus\Content\Paks\mods. If there is no mods folder, create one inside Paks
* Download .pak file from here and put it in the mods folder.
* See the warning above regarding placing multiple mods in this folder! [Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software) is highly recommended!
