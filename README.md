***Since the Artemis T5 Armor pieces are now all part of Dexterhaven Labs, this mod will no longer be updated.***

<a name="mod">__T5 "Artemis" Armor__</a>

Highest-tier armor which combines or improves on features of most other armor sets. Upgrades your already-crafted HDP Composite armor with exotics and platinum weave for the strongest, most versitle protection available. Note that the Artemis helmet requires microcontrollers for diagnostics and dynamic stabilization of the exotic field.
