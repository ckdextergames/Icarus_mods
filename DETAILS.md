**Hit the Ground Running: Starter Packs from DexterHaven Labs -- Detailed pack listing:**

**IMPORTANT WARNING**: Make certain you have enough slots in your personal inventory to accomodate all the items in the pack you're buying! The packages have too many items for most player's inventory. So it is **highly recommend** to make sure you have **plenty of free inventory space**, open one sub-package at a time, then store them in a chest or cupboard to make room in your inventory. Once your inventory is freed up, then open the next sub-package. Some packs have *dozens of items*, so plan accordingly!

Notes:
- Workshop prices listed below are as {Ren / Exotics}. All packs require both Ren and exotics to research and craft.
- Packs 2-6 contain separate sub-packs which need to be right-click "consumed" to open. See the warning above before use.
